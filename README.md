# TermStab

TermStab: a tool for the estimation of thermal stability from the amino acid sequences of proteins

Running the Script on Ubuntu: 

Save the above code into a Python file (e.g., TermStab.py). 

Make it executable:

chmod +x TermStab.py

Run it using:

./TermStab.py

Users will be prompted to input their amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence, and the melting temperature will be calculated.

Feel free to customize the codon table or explore additional features in Biopython for more accurate Tm calculations! 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
